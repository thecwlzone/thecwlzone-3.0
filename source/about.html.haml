          I’ve been doing Rails development full time since 2009, and I’ve been working with the Ruby language since 2005.
        %p
          Prior to that, I spent 27 years in the semiconductor industry at Ford Microelectronics, Cypress Semiconductor and IBM. I was a DevOps before the buzzword was invented: doing a combination of software development and system administration, as well as acting as the local SME for the Electronic Design Automation tools vital for the creation of VLSI circuits.

          My Ford career in the 1980s was great fun. A Motor City exile working for a car company in Colorado - it doesn’t get much better than that. We were designing first generation automotive electronics during the week and running Mustangs and T-birds in SCCA Solo II competition on the weekends. Motor Head Nirvana. scca

          But all things come to an end, and when I ran out of interesting things to do at Ford I jumped ship to a VLSI design startup, that went under the following year. The design team was picked up by Cypress, and I spent 14 years at the Colorado Springs Design Center where we designed static RAMs that generated over $1.5 billion in revenue for the company. sram

          The Dot Bomb crash of 2000 seriously affected the semiconductor industry, and after dodging more layoffs than I care to remember, my number came up in 2005, and that was the end of the road with Cypress.
        %p
          The crew that was cut from Cypress represented a huge amount of VLSI expertise, and we persuaded IBM to let us set up a new VLSI design center in Colorado Springs. Yet another semiconductor market pullback ultimately killed that idea, and as an unwilling participant in the IBM 2009 layoffs, I decided it was long past time to stop chasing electrons. Fortunately, I had been hacking on Rails web sites and doing Ruby programming for awhile, so the transition to Rails web developer was a viable “second career” choice. And that’s where I am today.smiley1

        This is the 3.0 version of my web site.

        For this incarnation of the web iste, I decided to use Middleman, a Ruby-based static site generator. I use Middleman to build content, run the content through the Middleman compiler and then push the generated HTML pages to my site’s public directory.
      %p
        I use a number of web tools to create various effects on the site. See the “Generated by” section of the footnotes at the bottom of this page for a complete list.
      %p
        I have decided to continue to use the Wordpress blog tool even though Middleman has some very powerful built-in blogging features.Wordpress is a hugely popular web framework, it suits my purposes, and there are CSS themes and plugins galore.

        Web site hosting is done by NearlyFreeSpeech.net. NFSN is a no-frills, DIY metered service web hosting company. I’ve been with them since 2004. It costs me about $15 a year to run the site, plus another $10 for annual domain registration. It doesn’t get any cheaper. The “down side”: you get to do everything yourself, so you need to be a combination web developer and sys admin.

          all of my professional colleagues, past and present, who are too numerous to mention. I make it a point to surround myself with people who are smarter than I am, which forces me to go the extra mile.

          the Middleman team for putting together a very nice Ruby-based static site generator. It’s been fun. Thanks!

          I'm no longer a fan of Twitter (or any social media to be honest), but the Twiter Bootstrap team has done a great job in building a remarkable CSS styling framework for those of us with no sense of aesthetics. If the site looks good, it's due to Bootstrap.
