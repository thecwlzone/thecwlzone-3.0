        This is version 3.0 of my web site.
      %p
        For this incarnation, I decided to use
        = link_to "Middleman", "https://middlemanapp.com/", target: "_blank"
        &#44; a Ruby-based static site generator. I use Middleman to build content, run the content through the Middleman compiler and then push the generated HTML pages to my site’s public directory.
      %p
        I use a number of web tools to create various effects on the site. See the “Generated by” section of the footnotes at the bottom of this page for a complete list.
      %p
        I have decided to continue using the
        = link_to "Wordpress", "https://wordpress.com/", target: "_blank"
        blog tool even though Middleman has some very powerful built-in blogging features. Wordpress is a hugely popular web framework, it suits my purposes, and there are WP
        = link_to "CSS themes", "https://wordpress.org/themes/", target: "_blank"
        and
        = link_to "plugins", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/", target: "_blank"
        galore.
      %p
        Web site hosting is done by
        = link_to "NearlyFreeSpeech.net", "https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/", target: "_blank"
        &#46; NFSN is a no-frills, DIY metered service web hosting company. I’ve been with them since 2004. It costs me about $15 a year to run the site, plus another $10 for annual domain registration. It doesn’t get any cheaper. The “down side”: you get to do everything yourself, so you need to be a combination web developer and sys admin.

        The pictures on the site are from cool places we have visited at various times. Site photography and

        This site has been tested against the following web browsers:

          65.0 - I have been using Opera for awhile now, and I'm liking it a lot.
        %li
          = link_to "Brave", "https://brave.com/", target: "_blank"
          1.0 - My latest browser experiment. A lot of interesting privacy hooks built in.

          = link_to "Microsoft", "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/", target: "_blank"
          Internet Explorer 11, probably works OK with version 10 as well.

        I do not use

        but version 68 seems to be OK.
