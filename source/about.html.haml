        This is version 3.0 of my web site.
      %p
        For this version, I decided to use
        = link_to "Middleman", "https://middlemanapp.com/", target: "_blank"
        &#44; a Ruby-based static site generator. I use Middleman to build content, run the content through the Middleman compiler and then push the generated HTML pages to my site’s public directory.
      %p
        I use a number of web tools to create various effects on the site. See the “Generated by” section of the footnotes at the bottom of this page for a complete list.

        I have decided to continue using the
        = link_to "Wordpress", "https://wordpress.com/", target: "_blank"
        blog tool even though Middleman has some very powerful built-in blogging features. Wordpress is a hugely popular web framework, it suits my purposes, and there are WP
        = link_to "CSS themes", "https://wordpress.org/themes/", target: "_blank"
        and
        = link_to "plugins", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/", target: "_blank"
        galore.

        Web site hosting is done by
        = link_to "NearlyFreeSpeech.net", "https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/", target: "_blank"
        &#46; NFSN is a no-frills, DIY metered service web hosting company. I’ve been with them since 2004. It costs me about $40 a year to run the site, including the annual domain registration fee. It doesn’t get any cheaper. The “down side”: you get to do everything yourself, so you need to be a combination web developer and sys admin.
